            <a class="btn" href="https://github.com/jgarner148/ChildrensStoryBox" target="_blank">View project</a>
            <h2>Childrens Story Box - current</h2>
          </div>
          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p>This was an idea I came up with as a way to keep myself entertained during the 2020 UK lockdown. After planning the story using flowcharts, I began to research how I could make the program work as my original idea was to have the story be image based. The project is written in Python3 as this is the language I have the most experience with</p>
          <h3>What the program does</h3>
          <p>The program generates a story for the user by asking them a series of questions. The user is firstly greeted with a welcome page where they will be offered to start. After this they are asked their name and the name of a friend, as well as 5 multiple choice questions. It then picks, at random, a few options such as what happens during the activity they selected. This random aspect means that even if you picked the same options twice the story will mosy likely be somewhat different.</p>
          <h3>The projects current state</h3>
          <p>The program is in beta which means it is mostly finished and useable but there may be bugs that I haven't noticed during my debugging, as a program with this many branching options can take some time to test.
          <h3>Future plans and potential improvements</h3>
          <p>In the furture I plan to allow the user to pick between two story generation options:</p>
          <ul class="project_list">
            <li>The current hands on version were the user is asked for lots of information</p>
            <li>A mostly randomly generated method were the user only needs to put in their name</p>
          </ul>
          <p>There would also be the possibility of converting the program into an iOS and Android app. Moreover, the final story could be imaged based in the future by either still images or generated animations. Finally, there is several parts of the program that could be rewritten to be more efficient by using fewer lines of code. For example, when the user picks the activity each location is split up into its own function, this could be  combined into one function. This is certainly something I will fix in the future.</p>

      <!-- Project 2 -->
      <section class="project2">
        <div class="content-wrap">
          <div class="section-title">
            <a class="btn" href="https://github.com/jgarner148/All-about-Jack-Garner-Website" target="_blank">View project</a>
            <h2>All About Jack Garner Website - current</h2>
          </div>
          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p> I started working on this website to help me while learning HTML and CSS at university. I came up with the idea of a website that can be used to showcase myself and my work while taking part in a "LinkedIn Learn" course on CSS. I was taking this course to compliment what I was learning at university and to get ahead on the work. The website is written in only HTML and CSS. The site is still a work in progress. </p>
          <h3>What the website contains</h3>
          <p>The site contains multiple different pages each intended to display information that would traditionally live on a CV. However, this website is not intended to replace my CV as I will still be distributing it. On the site you will find detailed reports into my recent and other relevant projects as well as all the information about my education and work experience. There is also an "About Me" section which not only contains details about me but also a personal bio so the user can get to know me better. The website was written mobile first and has a completely responsive layout.</p>
          <h3>Intended users</h3>
          <p> The website is designed to be used by potential employers who want more detailed information than can be supplied through a cover letter and CV. However, I will still keep the website up to date with my current projects once I enter employment.</p>
          <h3>Future plans and potential improvements</h3>
          <p>I am planning to incorporate javascript animations in the near future. Once the site is completed I intend to host it on a .com or .co.uk domain if available. Furthermore, I would like to add cookies to the site to make it possible to track the usage. Finally, the CSS code could be greatly optimised to reduce repetition and improve load times.</p>

            <h2>Train information machine - current</h2>
          </div>
          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p>The purpose of this program was to teach myself how to use APIs. I wanted to do this because there will probably be points in future projects where use of these will be needed. I'm currently still figuring out how to manage the json files that my requests get returned as.</p>
          <h3>What the program does</h3>
          <p>The user is given the option to input a trains UID (a number that every UK train service has a unique version of), the program will then output either the trains origin station information, its destination station information or the train's operating company based on what the user requests when the program starts. The program uses the <a class="project_link" href="https://www.realtimetrains.co.uk/about/developer/pull/docs/" target="_blank">RealTimeTrains</a> open API however, a sign up is required to use it so it can generate you a username and password.</p>
          <h3> The projects current state</h3>
          <p>The program is not yet fully functional as the API sometimes doesn't accept the user's inputted data. Morever, I am still not able to convert the json file to a string leaving only the line of information that I am interested in.</p>
          <h3> Future plans and potential improvements</h3>
          <p>In the future I would like the user to be able to track the total distance they have travelled on trains by inputtng a train's UID. Improvements would involve the API working consistently as well as the program being able to store past searches in a .CSV file for reference later.</p>

            <h2>Java 21 Questions Quiz - 2021</h2>
          </div>
          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p>This projects purpose was to develop my first full program in Java, as I am just starting out with the language I needed to come up with a concept that I could do with my current knowledge but that could also be expanded apon in the future so that it wasn't too basic.</p>
          <h3>What the program does</h3>
          <p>Once the user has started the program it runs through 21 questions and asks the user to input an answer (either A, B or C). If the user gets the question correct it adds 1 to thier total score. Once all the questions have been answered a score between 0 and 21 is outputted based on the number of questions the user got correct. They are then given the option to view all the correct answers or exit.</p>

            <h2>Simple calculator - 2019</h2>
            <h3>About the project</h3>
            <p>I started this project as a way to learn how to make GUIs in Python3 using Tkinter.</p>
            <h3> What the program does </h3>
            <p>The program is a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide. It uses a GUI consisting of buttons and a text input field. The program, currently, can only take in two numbers plus the mathematical operator</p>
            <h3>Future plans and potential imrprovements</h3>
            <p>As mentioned earlier, the program can not deal with more complex and long equations. Considering this, I would like to give the calculator this funcationality as well as the ability to perform other funcations such as square routing, super-script numbers and a memory option. Finally, I may port this project over to Java as a way to help me learn how to do GUIs in that language</p>

            <h2>F1 driver points calculator - 2019</h2>
          </div>
          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p>Initally written as a lesson warm up task during A-Level, this project is included on this list as it is something I would like to expand apon in the near future as right now the project is in a pretty basic state at the moment</p>
          <h3> What the program does</h3>
          <p>The program is a for loop that loops for the number of races there are in that season (for this case it is 22. The user then inputs the position that they finished in that particular race. It then adds the corisponding number to a running total while also printing out the current average. Once the loop has finished the total points for the season will be printed.</p>
          <h3> Future plans and potential improments</h3>
          <p>In the furture I would like to revive this project by adding more funcationality, such as a an options to generate team points not just driver points, and improving its current funcationality with error checking of users imput and a better text based or GUI user design</p>

            <h2>OCR Tunez - 2018</h2>
            
          </div>
          <h3>About the project</h3>
          <p>This project was my GCSE coursework and one of my first large projects. The idea was suppied by the exam board (OCR) which is where the name comes from. The idea for the program was to be a text based version of music streaming services like Spotify however actually playing/streaming music was outside of the scope of the coursework</p>
          <h3>What the program does</h3>
          <p>The user first has to sign into the program which uses a very basic .CSV file based system for storing and creating users. Once this is done the user can pick between several ways to play music such as a randomly shuffled playlist. After this the user can pick to listen to more musci or sign out.</p>

          <h2>Future Projects</h2>
          <h3>Population simulation</h3>
          <p>I initally intend for this to be a very simple simulation of population growth of a given group. It will only take into account things such as likelyhood of reporduction and likelyhood of death but as my skills develop I'd like to be able to add to this with things such as enviromental changes and mass extinctions.</p>
          <h3>Wifi locator</h3>
          <p>Originally intended to be my A-level coursework in 2020, this program would use indoor map data, wifi strength and triangulation to work out someones position in a building. The intended use would be for emergency service workers to be able to locate a caller or trapped person. I originally had the idea after watching a video online about how first responders often struggle to find people in the high rise buildings that are common today.</p>
          <h3>Carnival mobile game</h3>
          <p>As a way to expand my developing knowledge into gaming, in the future I am planning on developing a mobile game based around carnival games such as hook-a-duck and the ball toss.</p>
          <h3>A car news blog</h3>
          <p>As a way to combine two of my biggest interests, coding and cars, I am planning on starting a self written blog all about the lastest car news. Not only will this be a way for me to enjoy my interests it will also allow me to build a website from the begining with Javascript in mind, which will be great for my learning. This project is most likely far in the future so I can commit more time to developing it and keeping it updated.</p>
