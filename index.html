              <p> I'm a 19 year old programmer studying Software Engineering at Edge Hill Univeristy.</p>
              <p> My main programming language is Python3.</p>
              <p> Over the past couple of months I have started to learn HTML and CSS and will be expanding out to Javascript in the near future.</p>
              <p> These newly learnt web coding skills are what I have used to make this website.</p>
              <p> I've also just started learning Java.</p>

            <p>This was an idea I came up with as a way to keep myself entertained during the 2020 UK lockdown. </p>
            <p>The program allows the user to enter a number of parameters, such as their name and it will generate a story.</p>
            <p>The main section of this program to complete however this is an ongoing project that I will constantly be updating.</P>
