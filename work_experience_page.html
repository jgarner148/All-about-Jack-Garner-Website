          <h1>Senior ambassador</h1>
          <h3>Calderstones School, September 2018 - April 2020</h3>
          <p>I got this role due to my previous work as a language leader for many years (see below). Myself and six others were responsible for choosing the members of and running the school council every year. We also planned, managed and staffed school events such as open days which regularly involved promoting the school to prospective parents. Moreover, we regularly attended meetings with high-level staff and governors at the school. Once a month, through this role, I was a member of a Liverpool council committee that was focused on the environment and safety in and around schools. We also ran some of the schools social media such as the school council's Twitter page.</p>
