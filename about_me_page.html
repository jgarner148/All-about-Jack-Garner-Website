          <h1>Profile</h1>
          <p>I am a first-year software engineering student who has a deep-rooted passion for programming, computers and how they work. My free time will often be spent coding or developing new skills. One skill that I recently learned was HTML and CSS, these are what I used to develop this site. I have also just started learning Java and Javascript which I will be implementing into my <a class="link_profile" href="project_page.html">projects</a> in the near future. I have been programming since 2015 and I started with Python3 and had been using that for many years until I started university. After this, I started expanding my coding knowledge and plan to expand it even further in the future.</p>
